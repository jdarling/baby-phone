DESCRIPTION
===========

There is something about a cell phone that just attracts babies to cell phones. Their colors, textures, and everything about them just makes the little ones want to chew and play with them. 

There are lots of toy phones on the market, but if you have tried these they seldom hold tykes attention more than a few minutes. 

My idea is different in that it will be built to look exactly like a modern cell phone with a full color display. Playful icons and full of colors and sounds. Will be customizable by parents. Want to keep it so it can be easily duplicated with full hardware and source code available. 

The case will be made from rubberized plastic like many tykes toys, but modeled after existing cell phone cases to keep the little ones attention.
